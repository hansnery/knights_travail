# Project: Knights Travails
The Knights Travail is a problem in finding the shortest path between two squares on a chess board as travelled by a knight. This uses a uniform cost search - basically a breadth first search with each move on the chess board being having an equal cost, so the shortest path will always have the least number of moves.
